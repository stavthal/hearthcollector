Feel fry to try this app out. It just demonstrates how ,the server that I have wrote in JavaScript, handles the data that comes back after requesting it from a Hearthstone API, by using axios alongside express. The data from the app is probably not up to date as the last update to the API was a year ago, so a few expansions might be missing out.
